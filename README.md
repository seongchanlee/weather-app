# Weather App (5-Day Forecast)

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Introduction
I created this to practice and learn React. It shows 5-day forecast of Vancouver, BC at 12:00PM. 

## Modules Used
- Create React App
- Material UI

## Possible Improvements
- Accurate weather data; OpenWeather provides 5-day forecast in the span of 3 hours. I could perhaps aggregate the data to provide min/max temperature of the day.
- Since I'm new to React, there could be some areas where I didn't follow the common code style or coding practices.
